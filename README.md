## ‚ú® Key Features
Peer-to-Peer Connection: Video and audio streams are sent directly between users using WebRTC, ensuring low latency and high privacy.

Real-time Communication: High-quality, real-time video and audio streaming.

Minimalist "Glassmorphism" UI: A modern, unobtrusive interface with auto-hiding controls to maximize the focus on the conversation.

Draggable Video: The local user's video is a draggable picture-in-picture element.
